## Discovery Part:
  1. Create the network topology and transfer the related python scripts to the nodes. Every node has its own script and its related scripts are named the same with the name of the node. For the discovery part the scripts are under the "discovery" folder.
  2. Run the scripts. All scripts should be run together to obtain a successful result. 
    ```
      $ python s.py
    ```
  3. The result files will be on the nodes r1,r2,r3 and will be named "link_costs.txt".

## Experiment Part:
  For this part, only the nodes s, r3, d are used because the shortest path contains only these nodes.
